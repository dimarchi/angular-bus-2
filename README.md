# angular-bus

## A short introduction

This particular repository is an updated version of an already existing repository (angular-bus). It has issues with tslint and legacy dependencies, hence the code has been transferred to a new, clean Angular project. Other than that, it is the same, with minor modifications.

Three closest bus stops to your location, with data from [digitransit.fi](https://digitransit.fi) (not complete, therefore), valid only in Finland as this uses data specific to Finland.

Documentation is now up-to-date.
