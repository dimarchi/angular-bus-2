# angular-bus

## A short introduction

Three closest bus stops to your location, with data from [digitransit.fi](https://digitransit.fi) (not complete, therefore), valid only in Finland as this uses data specific to Finland.

Documentation is usually behind the current commit. If so, the reason for this is that something is not finished or at the state I am not happy about it. Therefore until that is fixed the documentation will not reflect the current status. Currently, the documentation is not up-to-date due to addition of the *Update location* button.
