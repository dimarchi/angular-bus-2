# angular-bus

## A short introduction

This particular repository is an updated version of an already existing repository (angular-bus). It has issues with tslint and legacy dependencies, hence the code has been transferred to a new, clean Angular project. Other than that, it is the same, with minor modifications.

Three closest bus stops to your location, with data from [digitransit.fi](https://digitransit.fi) (not complete, therefore), valid only in Finland as this uses data specific to Finland.

Documentation is usually behind the current commit. If so, the reason for this is that something is not finished or at the state I am not happy about it. Therefore until that is fixed the documentation will not reflect the current status. Currently, the documentation is not up-to-date due to addition of the *Update location* button.
